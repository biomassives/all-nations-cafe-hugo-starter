## ALL NATIONS CAFE - JERUSALEM

**Mission**

To serve as a hub where people from all religions, nationalities, and backgrounds can gather to

meet and greet one another for respectful dialogue, meaningful interaction, creative

collaboration, and partnership to further a common agenda of true and lasting peace in the

Middle East and worldwide.

**Why Jerusalem?**

Jerusalem has long been the city associated with the coexistence of the world’s major religions;

it has inspired enlightened beings to rise above differences and reach across the divide in times

of conflict. The time has never been more appropriate for a global effort to cultivate and

support peace in this complex and wondrous city, where it can become a shining example of

what is possible.

**Business Model**

ANC-Jerusalem represents version 2.0 of an initiative that started in 2005. The website “All

Nations Café | Home” describes version 1.0 of that initiative. Version 2.0 will build on the

successes of version 1.0 and add several business and tech components.

ANC-Jerusalem combines three components: (i) An affordable and inviting vegan café serving

locally-sourced, lovingly prepared foods; (ii) a cooperative/collaborative workhub; and (iii) a

center for programming that inspires peace by offering workshops and trainings in non-violent

communication, meditation, music, art, dance and creative writing, business development,

appropriate technology, sustainable practices, and leadership . All programming will be live-

streamed to members around the world. ANC- Jerusalem will serve as a proof of concept for a

future network of ANC cafes in major cities worldwide.

**Business Roll-out**

Phase I of the ANC concept will focus on developing the proof of concept in Jerusalem proper. It

will include developing the cafe and the community center/networking space. Our goal is to

launch this phase on June 24, 2021, and run phase I in 2021 and 2022. Starting in summer 2022,

ANC-Jerusalem will include a hostel, extending the welcoming, peaceful space to include

international travelers. In Phase III, starting in 2023, we plan to expand the ANC-Jerusalem to

other cities. Our vision is to franchise our brand, “The All-Nations Cafe,” in cities everywhere,

much like the “Hard Rock Cafe.”

**Financial Model**

The food business is notoriously difficult in Israel, with high overhead costs and low profit

margins. Jerusalem’s restaurants rely heavily on the tourist trade, of which there has been zero

for more than a year. That said, our goal is to run a break-even food business, with two income

streams separate from the café. One is the workhub, which will run on daily, monthly or annual

membership fees, and our international annual membership model.

**Membership Model**

Standard membership: $365/day (i.e., $1 per day/year for peace). With 1,000 members at this

price, we reach breakeven.
