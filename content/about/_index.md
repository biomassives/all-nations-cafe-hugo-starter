## ALL NATIONS CAFE - JERUSALEM

True to its spirit, the All Nations Café is focusing on bridging walls and creating closeness between Palestinians and Israelis and on inspiring a new generation of leaders and social innovators. As in its beginning, when the café was opened on the border of East and West Jerusalem, so it is today on the border of Palestine and Israel. In a fertile land that used to be No Man's Land, and has become a military zone between the last houses of Palestinian villagers and the first houses of Israeli Jerusalemites. This way we have the great opportunity to bring people of both sides of the border, in an atmosphere of intimacy without intimidation, to come together and share their feelings, aspirations

ANC-Jerusalem's mission is serve as a hub where people from all religions, nationalities, and backgrounds can gather to meet and greet one another for respectful dialogue, meaningful interaction, creative collaboration, and partnership to further a common agenda of true and lasting peace in the Middle East and worldwide.

**Why Jerusalem?**

Jerusalem has long been the city associated with the coexistence of the world’s major religions; it has inspired enlightened beings to rise above differences and reach across the divide in times of conflict. The time has never been more appropriate for a global effort to cultivate and support peace in this complex and wondrous city, where it can become a shining example of what is possible.

ANC-Jerusalem combines three components: (i) An affordable and inviting vegan café serving locally-sourced, lovingly prepared foods; (ii) a cooperative/collaborative workhub; and (iii) a center for programming that inspires peace by offering workshops and trainings in non-violent communication, meditation, music, art, dance and creative writing, business development, appropriate technology, sustainable practices, and leadership . All programming will be live-streamed to members around the world. ANC- Jerusalem will serve as a proof of concept for a future network of ANC cafes in major cities worldwide.

**Business Roll-out**

Phase I of the ANC concept will focus on developing the proof of concept in Jerusalem proper. It will include developing the cafe and the community center/networking space. Our goal is to launch this phase on June 24, 2021, and run phase I in 2021 and 2022. Starting in summer 2022, ANC-Jerusalem will include a hostel, extending the welcoming, peaceful space to include international travelers. In Phase III, starting in 2023, we plan to expand the ANC-Jerusalem to other cities. Our vision is to franchise our brand, “The All-Nations Cafe,” in cities everywhere, much like the “Hard Rock Cafe.”

**Financial Model**

The food business is notoriously difficult in Israel, with high overhead costs and low profit margins. Jerusalem’s restaurants rely heavily on the tourist trade, of which there has been zero for more than a year. That said, our goal is to run a break-even food business, with two income streams separate from the café. One is the workhub, which will run on daily, monthly or annual membership fees, and our international annual membership model.
