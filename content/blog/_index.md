## Our Work

![](https://allnations.cf/images/main-feature.png)

#### Gatherings

Our gatherings by the Ein Haniya spring have been gradually growing since 2006 into regular get-togethers, where intimate listening, spiritual openness and family-like celebration draw people of all nations to come together every week and bring their feelings, ideas and longings. Palestinians come from towns, villages and refugee camps in the West Bank, Israelis come from Jerusalem area, the Galilee and even from settlements, and internationals from all around the world.

#### Creativity Camps

Bringing out the creative spirit that lives in every child (and adult). Creating an alternative sheltering environment during challenging turbulent times.

#### Caravans

Special tours to Israel, Palestine and the space in between. Personally getting to know the people and landscapes from up close. We have also gone on musical caravans in the Middle East and in Europe.

#### Permaculture

Working together on the land, farmers and volunteers of all nations. Restoring terraces and springs, collecting garbage, digging water catchment cellars and so on.
