### **Mission**

To serve as a hub where people from all religions, nationalities, and backgrounds can gather to meet and greet one another for respectful dialogue, meaningful interaction, creative collaboration, and partnership to further a common agenda of true and lasting peace in the Middle East and worldwide.

Why Jerusalem: Despite its apparent socio-cultural-religious divisions and human-made boundaries, Jerusalem has long been the city associated with the coexistence of the world’s major religions; it has inspired enlightened beings to rise above differences and reach across the divide in times of conflict. The time has never been more appropriate for a global effort to cultivate and support peace in this complex and wondrous city, where it can become a shining example of what is possible.   
  
ANC-Jerusalem represents version 2.0 of an initiative that started in 2005. The website “[All Nations Café | Home](https://allnations.cf/)” describes version 1.0 of that initiative. Version 2.0 will build on the successes of version 1.0 and add several business and tech components.
